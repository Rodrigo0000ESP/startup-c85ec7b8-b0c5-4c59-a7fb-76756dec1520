The backend/app.py file will contain functions for fetching data from various sources, aggregating this data, applying AI algorithms for analysis and visualization, generating decision recommendations based on the analysis, and sending real-time alerts for critical insights. This file will interact with MongoDB for data storage, process the data using Python AI algorithms, and provide the necessary data to the frontend React application for display.
