The app.py file will define routes and functions for data collection from different sources, processing the data using machine learning algorithms from TensorFlow or PyTorch, and generating real-time insights and recommendations based on the analysis. The Flask or Django framework will be used for web server functionality to interact with the frontend React.js application and the PostgreSQL database for data storage.
