The app.py file will include functions for data aggregation from multiple sources using Python. It will then feed this aggregated data into the TensorFlow AI models for analysis and trend forecasting. The results will be stored in MongoDB for later retrieval. Finally, the file will have functions to generate visualizations based on the insights gained from the AI analysis and provide the necessary data for the customizable dashboard.
