The app.py file acts as the main entry point for the backend server. It receives incoming data from different sources, processes and aggregates the data, then passes it to the AI algorithms for predictive analytics. The AI algorithms forecast outcomes and generate insights, which are used to provide real-time decision recommendations. These recommendations are then sent back to the frontend for display to the user. The file is responsible for coordinating the flow of data, analysis, and recommendations within the application.
