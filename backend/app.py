The app.py file will handle the data collection process from multiple sources, perform data aggregation, and then pass this data to the AI algorithms for analysis. The AI algorithms will identify trends and patterns in the data, which will be used to generate real-time insights. These insights will then be sent to the frontend for visualization using React for easy interpretation by the users.
