The backend/app.py file will contain routes and functions for receiving incoming data from different sources, processing and aggregating the data, passing it to the AI algorithms for analysis, and returning real-time insights, recommendations, and predictions to the front-end interface. It will interact with the PostgreSQL database for data storage and retrieval, as well as communicate with the AI models for analysis. The file will be structured to handle requests efficiently, ensuring timely delivery of insights for informed decision-making.
