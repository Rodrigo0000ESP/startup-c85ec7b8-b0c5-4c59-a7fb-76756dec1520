Define routes in the routes.py file using Django's URL patterns to map endpoints to specific functions. Implement request handling logic in these functions to process incoming data, interact with the database (MongoDB), execute AI algorithms (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn), generate insights, and return appropriate responses. Ensure proper error handling and security measures are in place.
