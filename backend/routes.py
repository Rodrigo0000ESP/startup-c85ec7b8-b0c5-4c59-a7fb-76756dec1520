The routes.py file will define the endpoints and corresponding functions to handle incoming HTTP requests. It will include functions to trigger data integration, predictive analytics, and decision recommendation processes. The logic will involve parsing incoming data, invoking appropriate AI algorithms for analysis, and generating responses with insights or recommendations. The file will interact with the data storage and processing services on AWS and coordinate the flow of data between different modules of the application.
