The 'backend/routes.py' file will define routes using a Python web framework like Flask or Django. Each route will correspond to a specific feature such as data aggregation, AI-driven analysis, or decision recommendations. The logic within these routes will handle incoming requests, trigger the necessary data processing using TensorFlow for machine learning algorithms, perform data aggregation, run AI-driven analysis, and provide decision recommendations based on the input data. The responses will be formatted as JSON and returned to the user interface for display.
