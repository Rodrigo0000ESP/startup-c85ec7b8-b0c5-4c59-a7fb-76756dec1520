This file will define the routes for data aggregation, AI-driven analysis, and dashboard visualization. It will handle incoming data requests, process them using AI algorithms, and return the generated insights. The logic will involve receiving data, passing it through AI algorithms, and returning the analyzed data for visualization on the dashboard.
