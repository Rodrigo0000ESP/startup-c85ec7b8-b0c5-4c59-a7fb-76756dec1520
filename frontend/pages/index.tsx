The index.tsx file will contain the layout structure of the main page, including components for the customizable dashboard and data visualizations. It will fetch data from the backend API endpoints to populate the dashboard with key metrics and insights. User interactions such as selecting different metrics to display will trigger requests to the backend for updated data. The file will also handle the rendering of AI-generated insights based on the data analysis results.
