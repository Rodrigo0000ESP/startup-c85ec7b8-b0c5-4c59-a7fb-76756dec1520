As a senior software engineer, you would implement the logic in the Header.tsx file to fetch data from the backend APIs that aggregate data from various sources. Once the data is received, you would pass it to the AI algorithms for analysis and insights generation. The file would then display the customizable decision support recommendations and real-time data visualization using React components. Integration with the backend and other startup tools would also be handled within this file.
