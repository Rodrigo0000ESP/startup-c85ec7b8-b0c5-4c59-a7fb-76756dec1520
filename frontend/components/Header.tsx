The Header.tsx file will receive input data or parameters from the application state or props. It will use React to render the header component with dynamic content based on the input data. This could include user information, notifications, or relevant data for decision-making. The logic will involve structuring the header layout, handling different states or user roles, and updating the header based on real-time data changes or user interactions.
