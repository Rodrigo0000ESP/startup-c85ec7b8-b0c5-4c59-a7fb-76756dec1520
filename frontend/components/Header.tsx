The Header.tsx file contains React component code that defines the structure and behavior of the header section. It may include JSX elements for logo, navigation links, user profile, search bar, or any other header components based on the design. The logic involves handling user interactions, dynamic rendering based on state changes, and potentially fetching data to display dynamic content in the header.
