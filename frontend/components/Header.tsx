The Header.tsx file contains React.js code to define the structure and styling of the header component. It may include logo display, navigation links, user authentication status, and any other relevant information. The logic involves creating a functional or class component that renders the necessary elements using JSX syntax and CSS styles. Interaction with backend APIs for dynamic content or user-related data may also be implemented within this file.
