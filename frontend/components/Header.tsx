The Header.tsx file will contain React component code that defines the layout, styling, and functionality of the header section. It may include JSX elements for displaying text, icons, buttons, or other UI elements specific to the header. This file will handle the rendering of the header based on the input data provided, such as dynamic content or user preferences. It will interact with other components and data sources as needed to complete the overall user interface.
