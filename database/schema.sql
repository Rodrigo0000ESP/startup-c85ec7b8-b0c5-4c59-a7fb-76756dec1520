The schema.sql file contains SQL statements to create tables, define columns, set constraints, and establish relationships between tables. This file will be used to initialize the database structure according to the defined schema. It ensures that the database is properly configured to store and manage the data required for the AI algorithms and decision support system. The schema design should align with the data collection and integration framework to enable efficient data processing and analysis.
